# cs50
Source code I wrote in 2018 for Harvard's CS50x course.

Languages taught in this course: C, Python, HTML/CSS/JS + SQL

Projects for this course included a spellchecker, tweet analyzer, pseudo-stock portfolio management system (doesn't use real money), location-based news feed generator, and a choose-your-own-topic final projectâ€”I decided to do an assignments planner.
